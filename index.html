            <p class="pragraph">There are a number of reasons why you might need to backup your iPhone. Perhaps you are changing to a newer model of the Apple iPhone and want to transfer all of your data, apps, settings and other content to your new device. You might also run into a situation where it’s necessary to return your iPhone to factory settings and you need to wipe your phone clean of everything.


            </p>
            <p>It is advisable to regularly create backups of your phone’s contents, so that nothing gets lost either due to an accident or some other unexpected issue. There are different ways for you to backup your iPhone. We’ll walk you through the different steps so you can keep your precious data safe and available for backup.

            </p>
            <p>In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to backup your iPhone using iCloud or iTunes. Please note that these steps are applicable to all iPhone models running iOS 12 or later.


            </p>
            <h2>Method 1: iCloud backup
            </h2>
           
            <h4>Step 1: Connect to Wi-Fi
            </h4>
            <p>Make sure your iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network. iCloud backups require a stable internet connection.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Open Settings
            </h4>
            <p>Go to the home screen of your iPhone and tap on the “Settings” app. It is represented by a gear icon.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 3: Tap on your Apple ID
            </h4>
            <p>Scroll down and tap on your Apple ID at the top of the Settings menu. This will open your Apple ID settings.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 4: Access iCloud Settings
            </h4>
            <p>Tap on “iCloud” to access the iCloud settings.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 5: Enable iCloud Backup
            </h4>
            <p>Scroll down and tap on “iCloud Backup”. Toggle the switch to enable it if it is not already turned on.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 6: Initiate Backup
            </h4>
            <p>Tap on “Back Up Now” to start the backup process. Ensure that your iPhone is connected to a power source and has enough storage space on iCloud to complete the backup.

            </p>
            <p>In case you want to have your phone do a backup automatically, you can toggle the “iCloud” -selection at the top of the “iCloud Backup” -page. To do this, your iPhone has to be charging and have a Wifi connection. Remember to also check that you have enough storage space in iCloud to store all of your data.
